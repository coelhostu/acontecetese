# What if...? A laboratory in interactive animation 

This project was initiated in 2019, with production starting in 2021, post-pandemic, and with the MVP version completed in 2023, within the context of educational research. 
An interactive rotoscope animation narrative in 360o. The rotoscope technique involves creating animated sequences by tracing over real-life images, frame by frame.

As a basis for the drawings, 360-degree first-person footage was recorded, allowing viewers to see the arms and body of an actor. This means that the user of the experience views events through the eyes of a character, as if they were the characterthemselves. To avoid potential discomfort, the 360-degree videos were captured in real time using a fixed Insta360 ONE X camera, allowing the user to look in all directions, albeit from a fixed position.

The work is inspired by black and white comic books. Only highlighted objects become colored, acting as points of interest to direct the user's attention.

This is a non-linear narrative with educational purposes, where, depending on the user's choices, different paths can be explored in the story, similar to gamebooks (known as "Choose Your Own Adventure").
